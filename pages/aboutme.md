Hi, I'm almamber!

I'm a 15 year old hobby-programmer. In programming, I'm interested in:
* C development
* Go development (I'm only learning though)
* To an extent, web development

Regarding music, I like Mike Oldfield's and Kraftwerk's work, and vapor/synthwave.

I hate emojis with a burning passion.

I hope you will have an enjoyable stay on this site.
